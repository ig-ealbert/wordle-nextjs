# Wordle in Next.js and TypeScript

## Overview

I made Wordle as a way to teach JavaScript and React to a friend. It's fun to learn through games! :tada:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Running the Project

Install the project the first time only.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the project.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

Having used Wordle for teaching, I found out my rules were wrong. :sweat_smile: But I like them anyway.

1. You only get 5 guesses instead of 6.
2. You can guess words that aren't in the dictionary.

I like that these two alternate rules balance each other out. It's harder with one less guess, but it's easier when you don't have to make a real word.
